/*
* It is important to define the packages in which your protocol buffer messages live:
    1. When your code gets compiled, it will be placed in the package that you indicated.
    2. It helps prevent naming conflicts between messages. e.g. my.package1.Person and
        my.package2.abc.Person
* Packages will help all the different languages compile correctly from .proto files.
